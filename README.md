angular-data-picker-tutorial
============================

Audience
--------
This tutorial is meant for Javascript and AngularJS beginners like me who already went
through the [official AngularJS tutorial](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial), and
preferrably, through the [AngularJS in one week end program](http://joelhooks.com/blog/2013/08/03/learn-angularjs-in-a-weekend/).
For this tutorial you will need a browser, a text editor and a git client.

Objective
---------
My personal objective when writing this tutorial was to see how AngularJS can be used to write a simple form. As we know, even for the most simple data model, you will depend on a dictionary of some sort:
* it could be a list of countries
* or some other sort of data with a very high number of items

Typically, a dropdown list is used when the number of items is small. For large lists,
you will have to search for your data. This is the *topic of this tutorial*: to explore how a search "widget" embeddable in a simple form can be implemented with AngularJS.


First step
----------
All the necessary code is provided below to complete this tutorial.
Alternatively, you can retrieve it from Github. Using your git client, get this tutorial with

    git clone https://github.com/adelinor/angular-data-picker-tutorial.git

Afterwards, check out the branch *step01* to get the code for the completed first step:

    git checkout step01

In the first step, we setup a project folder, and three files: one for the HTML page, one
for the AngularJS code and one for a mock JSON message that simulates a call to the
backend.
```
     +
     |
     +- app/
     |   |
     |   +- index.html
     |   |
     |   +- js/
     |       |
     |       +- controllers.js
     |
     +- messages/
         |
         +- search-orgs.js
```

First we build a message that emulates the results returned by a backend implementation. The file *search-orgs.js* contains only two items:

```js
[
{
	"dn": "uniqueIdentifier=1000,dc=orgs",
	"displayName": "Javascript development org"
},
{
	"dn": "uniqueIdentifier=1001,dc=orgs",
	"displayName": "Enthusiastic user org"
}
]
```

Then we create the *index.html* page:

```html
<html lang="en" ng-app>
<head>
	<title>Picker</title>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.8/angular.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/controllers.js"></script>
</head>

```

The head section links to the [Bootstrap CSS framework](http://getbootstrap.com) and to
AngularJS version 1.0.8.
The `html` tag contains the attribute `ng-app` to let AngularJS know that this HTML page contains an AngularJS application.

To test this setup, we want to display the data from search org message. We use
AngularJS's ng-repeat, so here is the rest of the *index.html* file:

```html
<body>
<h2>Let's test stuff</h2>
<p>
<ul ng-controller="OrgsListCtrl">
	<li ng-repeat="org in searchResults">
		{{org.displayName}}
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
</body>
</html>
```

A controller, OrgsListCtrl, is declared in the `ul` element. This allows to fetch data and
store in the `scope` to make it available. In the `li` we iterate through the search results using the `ng-repeat` directive.

In the file *controllers.js* file, the controller is written with a simple function
as shown in the
[Angular tutorial step 5](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05). We use the out of
the box `$http` service to invoke the search. The result of the search is stored in the scope under the name `searchResults`.
```js
function OrgsListCtrl($scope, $http) {
	$http.get('../messages/search-orgs.js').success(function(data) {
		$scope.searchResults = data;
	});
}
```

Now open the *index.html* page with your browser and you should see the list of
organisations displayed:

![Screenshot of expected output](site/step01.png) .

Et voil√†, that's it for the first step.

Second step
-----------
We are now going to start developing a form for entering people. To keep it as simple
as possible, we only enter one free text field for a person in this step.

You can get the code that completes this step by checking out the branch *step02*:

    git checkout step02

So, let's start editing the file *index.html*.

Let's add a bit of padding around the page:
```html
<body style="padding: 1em;">
```

Let's remove all content that was there previously within the body tag and add
the HTML elements for the People editor.

We start with a title:
```html
<h1>People</h1>
```

We add the form container, the CSS class indicates to only use half of the width (6 columns out of 12):
```html
<form class="form col-xs-6" role="form">
</form>
```

Within the `form` element we add the input for the person:
```html
<fieldset>
	<legend>Add person</legend>
	<div class="form-group">
		<label class="control-label" for="personName">Name</label>
		<input type=text" class="form-control" id="personName" placeholder="Enter name">
	</div>
	<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Add</button>
</fieldset>
```

At the same time we want to display the list of people who have been registered already
and provide a link to allow to edit an existing record.
For that purpose, we add a `div` container after the `</form>` closing tag. Its CSS class tells to occupy half of the display (6 columns out of 12):

```html
<div class="col-xs-6">
<fieldset>
	<legend>Already registered</legend>
	<ul>
		<li>A recorded name
			<a href="#">edit</a>
        </li>
</ul>
</fieldset>
</div>
```
This form which has no behaviour for the moment, renders as shown below:

![Simple form for adding person](site/step02_form.png) 

Now let's add some basic behaviour: clicking "add" will register the person. Clicking "edit" will bring a popup to indicate what person is edited. All data is saved in memory.

With AngularJS, HTML elements with behaviour must be under the supervision of a controller.
To do so we add a `ng-controller` declaration in the body element:

```html
<body style="padding: 1em;" ng-controller="PeopleCtrl">
```

We also add a declaration on the text input for the person's name: this is to bind the input to the model. We give the attribute name of `personNameNG`.

```html
<input type=text" class="form-control" id="personName" placeholder="Enter name"
	ng-model="personNameNG">
```

When the form is submitted we want a person to be added so we add the `ng-submit`
declaration to the form element:

```html
<form ng-submit="addPerson()" class="form col-xs-6" role="form">
```

At the end of the file *controllers.js* we add a new controller and define the function
addPerson(). Please note that the function is defined in the object `$scope` which is
visible in child HTML elements of the ng-controller.

```js
function PeopleCtrl($scope, $http) {
	$scope.addPerson = function() {
		alert('You are adding a person with name=' + $scope.personNameNG);
	};
};
```

Test it now!! You should see a pop up when clicking on add.

We now add to the controller an array for the persons added. The
addPerson function is changed to push objects to that array:

```js
function PeopleCtrl($scope, $http) {
	$scope.people = [];

	$scope.addPerson = function() {
		var pos = $scope.people.length;
		$scope.people.push(
			{
				id: pos,
				name:$scope.personNameNG
			} );
		$scope.personNameNG = '';
	};
};
```

With this implementation, adding people does not provide feedback anywhere. We
now need to show the registered people. The `ng-repeat` declaration is used
in the *index.html* for that. The `li` element below: 

```html
	<li>A recorded name
		<a href="#">edit</a>
	</li>
```
is replaced with:

```html
	<li ng-repeat="p in people">
		{{p.name}} <a href="#">edit</a>
	</li>
```

To add behaviour to the edit link, we use a `ng-click` declaration on the hyperlink:

```html
<a ng-click="editById(p.id)" href="#">edit</a>
```

This will invoke the function editById and provide the id to edit as an argument.
This function needs to be added to the controller:

```js
$scope.editById = function(id) {
	alert('You want to edit person with ID=' + id);
}
```

And this concludes the second step :(
