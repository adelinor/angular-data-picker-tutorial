angular-data-picker-tutorial
============================

Audience
--------
This tutorial is meant for Javascript and AngularJS beginners like me who already went
through the [official AngularJS tutorial](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial), and
preferrably, through the [AngularJS in one week end program](http://joelhooks.com/blog/2013/08/03/learn-angularjs-in-a-weekend/).
For this tutorial you will need a browser, a text editor and a git client.

Objective
---------
My personal objective when writing this tutorial was to see how AngularJS can be used to write a simple form. As we know, even for the most simple data model, you will depend on a dictionary of some sort:
* it could be a list of countries
* or some other sort of data with a very high number of items

Typically, a dropdown list is used when the number of items is small. For large lists, you will have to search for your data.

This is topic of this tutorial: to explore how a search "widget" can be implemented with AngularJS.
