<h1>Very simple user interfaces</h1>
<p>
In a very simple user interface, a form will capture all information in one go. Unfortunately even the simplest domain data models will have attributes that are pointer to other types: for instance a reference to a country in an address.
</p>
<p>
If the data to choose has a small volume of records, as for countries for instance, one could use a simple drop down. But when there are too many records for a drop down or data needs to be searched, the drop down will not satisfy the bill.
</p>
<p>
Here I propose a picker for that purpose.

<h2>Let's test stuff</h2>
<p>
<ul ng-controller="OrgsListCtrl">
	<li ng-repeat="org in searchResults">
		{{org.displayName}}
	</li>
</ul>
